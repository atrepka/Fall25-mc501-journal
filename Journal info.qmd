Your **course journal** is a Quarto **book**. Each **week** has a chapter with **three prompts**—you answer **one**.  
Word ranges are enforced when you render:

- **MC 451:** **250–300** words  
- **MC 501:** **450–500** words

---

## Step 1 — Create a new RStudio Project

1. Open **RStudio** → **File → New Project → New Directory → New Project**.  
2. Choose a location (e.g., `Documents/MC451/`) and name it (e.g., `journal_project`).

---

## Step 2 — Install and load the course package

In the **Console**:

```r
pak::pak("SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack")
library(mccoursepack)
````

If prompted, restart R after installation.

---

## Step 3 — Download your starter journal

Run:

```r
download_journal("mc451", dest = ".")   # or "mc501"
```

This creates a folder `journal/` with everything you need.

---

## Step 4 — Add a new week chapter

From inside the `journal/` folder in the **Files** pane (click to enter it), run in the **Console**:

```r
# Pick your week number (2–14). Example:
new_journal_entry(week = 3)
```

What happens:

1. A new chapter is created and named with **today’s date**: `entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd`.
2. The **three prompts for that week** are inserted.
3. The correct **word range** for your course is set.
4. `_quarto.yml` is updated so the chapter appears in the book.

![Console showing `new_journal_entry(week = 3)` and “Created: entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd.](../images/journal-week.png "Choosing Week for Journal"){width=50%; fig-align="center"}

> **Troubleshooting:** If you run the command twice **on the same day**, the file will be overwritten (same date name). If you need to keep both, rename the first file (e.g., `2025-09-03b.qmd`) before running again.

---

## Step 5 — Choose your prompt, then write

Open the new file (e.g., `entries/2025-09-03.qmd`). You’ll see **Choose one prompt** first, then **Response**.

**Keep ONE prompt and delete the other two** in the *Choose one prompt* section. Then write your answer **only** inside the **Response** block.

### Choose **one** prompt to answer

> **Prompt A:** `r params$p1`
> **Prompt B:** `r params$p2`
> **Prompt C:** `r params$p3`

### Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->

*Write your answer to **one** of the prompts here. Do not write anything else in this chapter.*

<!-- RESPONSE-END -->

Stay in range:

* **MC 451:** 250–300 words
* **MC 501:** 450–500 words

## Step 6 — Render the **entire** journal (unified output)

You have two equivalent options. Use **one** of them:

**A) Click Render on `index.qmd`**

* In the Files pane, open `journal/index.qmd`.
* Click the **Render** button in the editor toolbar.
  *This renders the entire book.*

**B) Use the Console (renders the whole book)**

```bash
# From inside the journal/ folder:
quarto render
# Or explicitly:
quarto render index.qmd
```

Outputs are in `journal/_book/`:

* An **HTML** book (always, multi-page site with navigation = unified entity).
* **PDF/EPUB** if you have TinyTeX installed.

If a PDF fails to build, run:

```r
quarto install tinytex
# or
mccourse_setup()
```

> **Tip:** Rendering a single chapter file will **not** produce the unified journal. Always render **`index.qmd`** (or run `quarto render`) to build the whole book.



---

## Step 7 — Submit via GitHub

When you add or edit a chapter, **two files change**:

1. `journal/entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd`
2. `journal/_quarto.yml`

In RStudio:

1. Open the **Git** pane.
2. **Stage** both changed files.
3. Add a commit message (e.g., “Week 3 journal entry”).
4. **Commit** and **Push**.

> If you forget `_quarto.yml`, your new chapter won’t appear for others.

## FAQ

**It didn’t ask me for the week number. Is that okay?**
Yes. In RStudio you usually call the function directly: `new_journal_entry(week = 5)`.

**My word count says “Out of range.”**
Edit until you are within the range for your course.

**The new chapter doesn’t appear in the rendered book.**
Be sure you rendered the **whole book** (Render `index.qmd` or run `quarto render`) and committed **both** the entry file and `_quarto.yml`.

**Can I revise later?**
Yes. Edit the same `entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd`, then commit and push again.

## Weekly checklist (quick self-audit)

* [ ] I created/updated a chapter for **this week** using `new_journal_entry(week = N)`.
* [ ] I kept **one** prompt and deleted the other **two**.
* [ ] I wrote my answer **inside the Response block** only.
* [ ] My word count is **in range**.
* [ ] I **rendered the whole book** by rendering `index.qmd` (or running `quarto render`).
* [ ] I **staged, committed, and pushed** `entries/YYYY-MM-DD.qmd` **and** `_quarto.yml`.
