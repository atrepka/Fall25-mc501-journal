  p1: 'Choose either the Nazi medical experiments or the Tuskegee syphilis study and reflect on what that case teaches us about the need for ethical safeguards in research. Why do you think these events had such a lasting impact on how research is conducted today? How might studying these cases shape your behavior as a future researcher?'
  p2: 'Imagine you are researching a public social media platform like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, or TikTok. Would you consider the content you’re analyzing to be public or private? Would you need to obtain informed consent? Why or why not? Reflect on the ethical gray areas that emerge in digital research and how you would navigate them.'
  p3: 'Think ahead to a study you might conduct as part of this course. What would it look like to fully honor the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in your research? Identify at least one concrete action you would take during your study’s design or data collection to uphold each of these three ethical principles.'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->

While World War II had so many, varied atrocities, as the case for most any war, I feel the Tuskegee syphilis study has a more deceptive, spiteful feel to the researchers methods. The end result of the Tuskegee experiments also reverberates through to today with its revelation spurring major changes in U.S. law and regulation with protecting participants in clinical studies. The Tuskegee syphilis study also showed that continuing, neutral oversight on research experiments is vital. Having an independent body monitor not just the design but also the continued conduct within the research allows for all parties to stay safe and informed along the way. 

I want to be clear that in choosing the Tuskegee syphilis study, I am not making light of the Nazi experiments. Countless lives were lost in brutal, unhuman ways. The ends absolutely did not justify their means. No thanks will be given by me for the research of either topics in this prompt.

Similar to the Nazi medical experiments, the Tuskegee syphilis study contained groups of people who were deemed “undesirable” or “expendable” by groups of those who performed the tests. In the case of the Tuskegee, these were 399 Black men. When there is a contemptuous spirit behind the research, the lack of informed consent and warnings about what may happen in the experiment make the study ripe for abuse in the name of science. It’s also important to remember that even after penicillin was found to treat syphilis, researchers prohibited test participants from getting the treatment. This further complicated their family lives as 19 children who were born from the participants had congenital syphilis. Study participants absolutely must know the risks, potential complications and outright purpose of the experiment they’re about to take part of. As stated earlier, the fallout from the Tuskegee syphilis study directly led to publishing the Belmont Report in 1979 and highlighted just how essential informed consent is when producing ethical research.

As a future researcher, I feel like I’m already ahead of the game, because I don’t intend to harm anyone in my research. Impact on participants is more important than my intent. Keeping this in mind, I would first start with mitigating any bias that I’m bringing to the research. Unconscious bias is a hell of a bias, so it would be beneficial for me to work with a diverse group of researchers from different backgrounds. Secondly, I would be as open and transparent about the impact of the research on the participants, including any actual experiments that would take place. Lastly, I would want to ensure that my work has oversight and guardrails set up by an IRB to keep me honest, ethical and on the legal side of the law.
