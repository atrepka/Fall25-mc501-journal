  p1: 'The chapter opens with the story of John Snow and the Broad Street pump—an example of how sampling can reveal powerful truths about a whole system. Reflect on a time you formed a strong opinion or insight based on a small piece of evidence (e.g., a social media post, a conversation, a single article). Was that sample representative of the broader reality? What does this example teach you about the risks or rewards of inference from a small sample?'
  p2: 'Imagine you are planning a study on how college students interact with AI tools like ChatGPT. Would you choose a probability sampling method or a non-probability one? Why? Consider your research goals—do you want to generalize to all college students or understand a specific group more deeply? Explain your choice and what trade-offs it involves in terms of access, time, cost, and generalizability.'
  p3: 'Much of today’s research relies on digital data—tweets, posts, videos, and online surveys. This chapter explains how population bias, self-selection bias, and data availability bias can distort digital research. Choose one of these forms of bias and describe how it might affect a study of online news consumption or streaming habits. What could a researcher do to acknowledge or reduce that bias?'

The example I would like to use for today’s prompt (Prompt A) is near and dear to my heart as an improviser. While it absolutely pales in comparison to John Snow and the Broad Street pump, it still lingers in my mind to this day. 

I did not have any theater experience in high school or college, outside of a one month long Improv class through the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Theater department. After my undergrad, I moved to Chicago in late 2009 and started taking Improv classes at the world-famous iO Theater in early 2010. Through taking classes and being a student, I got to see shows for free. Through being selected as an intern at the theater, I got to take classes for free. Improv 100% became my identity.

Before I even graduated from the iO Training Center, I had joined an independent Improv team that performed mostly at bars. After graduating from the Training Center, I was put on a highly-coveted iO house team. I also auditioned at other Chicago Improv theaters and was put on house teams there as well. I was actively performing most nights of the week and was fully immersed in the Chicago Improv scene.

Through many of the coaches I had over the years, one coach stood out to me: Mike Brunlieb. Brunlieb was a master thespian and improviser that I dearly looked up to for his zany choices and full commitment to flawed characters. Learning through him during my second iO house team definitely leveled me up as an improviser and actor. Brunlieb was well-versed in the “mother of Improvisational Theater”, Viola Spolin’s teaching exercises and would regularly utilize her exercises in rehearsal. One exercise was called “Excursion into the Intuitive”, a very advanced Improv exercise where essentially performers sit in chairs and only start to move when they feel compelled, the show goes on from there. No suggestion to kick off the piece, just organically creating with your team from the jump until the show is over. As you can imagine, there’s a lot of trust and groupwork to make this “form” coherent. One of my teammates at the time, Paul was less of an actor and more of a podcast host for the stage. He would stand and say funny things, but that was all he brought to the table. No objectwork, no accents, no body movement. After one of our “Excursion” shows, he remarked backstage that all we did during the show was “dance on stage”. I took offense to his sentiment, because to me our team was doing some incredibly high-level Improv that was so fulfilling to me. His offhanded comment helped me realize that not all improvisers are in it for the art. Some people use it as a stepping stone to fame. This sample size (one guy) did not knock me off of my path to continue doing the best work onstage that I can do. It did make me resent him though.
