  p3: 'Experiments often require researchers to deceive participants or control aspects of their environment. Reflect on how you feel about that. Do you think the benefits of experimental knowledge are worth these trade-offs? What would be essential to include in your debrief if you had to deceive participants in your study?'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
I believe the concept of deception in research and/or controlling for various aspects of the testing environment are necessary. However, the necessity certainly depends on the type of research and how much deception is thrust onto participants. I believe intelligently anticipating the needed control setting on the surface may have a smaller impact on participants than straight deception during the research questionnaire or experiment. The word deception carries a harmful connotation, where I believe its place in research is more of intentionally leaving out info or options in the experiment.

The world of scientific research has had strong, ethical walls built around it dating back to 1947’s Nuremberg Code which was then followed up by 1978’s Belmont Report, prompted by the unethical treatment in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Ethical researchers have internationally standardized methods to contend with questionable research practices, but this doesn’t always prevent harm in participants. Above all, I think preventing harm in participants has the utmost importance. Can a deceptive question on a survey “harm” a participant? Possibly. Is intentionally infecting an unknowing participant with syphilis harmful? Most definitely.

In order to measure genuine behavior or attitudes, researchers have to devise experiments that can get to the meat of what they’re looking to study. Cutting through stigma and cultural taboos may be hard to do without a little deception. It’s important to recognize that researchers are gambling with the participants’ trust in the researchers and participants may leave feeling manipulated. So long as the potential benefits of research outweigh any risks and participants are given a thorough debriefing afterward, I believe the researchers should be able to sleep at night with the potentially illuminating findings they come across. 

If I was working on a research study with my colleagues and we as a team decided that we HAD to deceive participants to get the unfiltered feedback we’re looking for, I would seek to restore trust with participants during the debrief. Leading with full disclosure, it would be absolving to explain the true purpose of the study and highlight what was deceptive. I think it’s also important to explain the rationale and ethics behind our work. With committees like the IRB, we can show that the research was approved by an ethics committee and highlight the lengths that were taken to protect them. Opening up an opportunity to withdraw their participants’ data when they understand the full context of any deceptive practices would be important to offer. Willingly answering participant questions and offering resources for emotional support would also ease any distress that participants may feel.

To sum things up, I believe deception is a strong word for what researchers do in their experiments and surveys. In the year 2025 with all of the established and respected ethical guidelines that are woven into the fabric of experimental research, participants should feel safe to give their honest results without fear of repercussions or fear of harm befalling them after the experiment is over.
