  p1: 'Reflect on the metaphor introduced at the beginning of the chapter: walking into a conversation that’s already underway. Have you ever had that experience in real life (in class, online, or at work)? What happened when you did—or didn’t—take the time to listen first? How does that scenario relate to the role of the literature review in research? Why is it important to understand what’s already been said before adding your ideas?'
  p2: 'Think about a media-related topic that interests you (e.g., influencer culture, video game violence, media portrayals of mental health). Now imagine you are preparing to write a literature review on that topic. What kind of “gap” would you look for to justify a new study? Would it be a topical void, a contradiction, or an overlooked perspective? Why does that kind of gap matter in media research?'
  p3: 'In your own words, explain the difference between an annotated bibliography and a proper literature review. Why is that difference significant? Reflect on a time when you had to summarize multiple sources for a paper or project. Did you organize those sources thematically, or treat each one individually? Looking ahead, how will your approach change when writing your literature review?'

```         
I appreciate the sentiment behind the “Entering the Scholarly Conversation” metaphor. It puts into perspective the ongoing conversation of research that has happened before I started my grad program and acknowledges all of the work researchers have previously. It’s crucial to be well-educated on past research and have a more zoomed out view as I hone in on my Research Question. As the article states, “No research project is conducted in a vacuum”. 
```

I have had experiences where I’ve shown up to an existing conversation going on between peers. Looking back generally on these interjections in their conversations, I feel the times it’s ended badly for me is not knowing the stance of the conversationalists before I open my mouth. For example, they may be talking highly about a coworker or regular customer that I may not like. I have put my foot in my mouth before for speaking ill of the people that the conversation favors. Personal opinions aside, I have also been part of conversations where the group of people are stumped on something and I have nothing to contribute to solve an issue. On the flipside, I have been in conversations where I THOUGHT I had a handle of the topic at hand. Then a friend walks over who is more knowledgeable than me and corrects the established answer. Utilizing a literature review to the fullest should reinforce my research question. If the question falls apart during the review, then it’s time to reconfigure my position or angle that I’m taking with my research. With so much research happening in the world at any given moment and hundreds of years of research potentially at our fingerprints, there’s no excuse to have an ill-informed research question in this class. Completing a proper literature review is essential work. Understanding the established scholarly articles, along with publicly available writings and sentiment on my topic, provides me scaffolding to build my research/work on. Being well-acquanted with the research will provide me with so much food for thought as I continue my march towards my final project and ultimately graduation. Leading with research ahead of my final project will give me a solid foundation to put my final project into action. At the current moment, I’m still very excited to explore how live events and video production can foster a strong sense of belonging with on-campus students at SIUE. The meager amount of research I’ve dug into has yielded some positive results in terms of having others who are also interested in belonging, campus culture and live events. More than anything, I’m interested in the benefits of “touching grass” and connecting people. I believe that making strong interpersonal connections in college does wonders for your life outside of college. <!-- RESPONSE-END -->
