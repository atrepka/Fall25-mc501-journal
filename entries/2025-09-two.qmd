  p1: 'Think about a claim you’ve seen online that you weren’t sure was true. How would the principles of empiricism and control help you design a study to test whether it was accurate?'
  p2: 'Choose a topic you’re curious about in media or communication (e.g., the effect of streaming on movie watching, how politicians use TikTok, portrayals of families on TV). Write a specific research question about it. Then, briefly describe what you would do in each of the five stages of the research workflow (Conceptualization, Design, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Communication) to answer it.'
  p3: 'Describe a time you learned a digital tool (in any context—school, work, a hobby) without really understanding the reasoning behind what you were doing. How might knowing the "why"—the tool-agnostic principles—have helped you use it more effectively, solve problems, or even choose a better tool for the task?'

A claim that I have seen online and have heard friends in education talk about is that the overwhelming majority (80%+) of college students get their news about the US and the world from TikTok. As disheartening as this claim may be, I find it difficult to believe that there are no other sources of media that students are consuming that would give them a wider array of more trusted news sources. Given that we are on a college campus, researching the question about news sources should be easy.

I would start by developing a survey asking, “Which platforms do you regularly use to get news?” and include TikTok, Instagram, TV, etc. In tandem with the survey, I would also try on-the-street and in-the-quad interviews to ask students directly about where they get their news from. There would also be broader data if we could source the digital usage data to measure TikTok news consumption. Gathering this data will help me eliminate any hearsay or speculative info I may have gotten from my peers or read online. Through the interviews and surveys I would have direct evidence to base my report on and my conclusions would be rooted in data-backed behavior.

I understand that this example of researching where students are “getting their news” is a bit vague to start. Controlling for this would be important so that I’m studying and testing the actual claim, not something related but different. It will be important for me to specifically and carefully define key terms as they pertain to my research topic. Some refining that I could do with my original research question would be:
What counts as “getting news”? 
What is considered “college-aged”? 18–24?
Does this count when reading/watching headlines?
Would “news” be engaging strictly with political content? 
Does entertainment news count?

There would also be controls for other variables that might influence news consumption:
Gender
Socioeconomic background
Community college vs. university
Access to other media (students in media studies vs. STEM)

After ideating on this example research topic, I believe having a random or representative sample from SIUE would be most beneficial. After establishing the final survey and interview protocols, I would ask participants how often they use TikTok for news, what kinds of news, and how it compares to other sources. It would be important to define "news" and "TikTok usage" clearly to students taking the survey. I would also want to get this survey out to other students at other universities/colleges in the US to get a larger data set to work with.

Again, I feel the research question, “What percentage of college-aged students (18–24) report TikTok as a primary source of news?” is one I’m a little worried to get the real answer to. If anything I feel more motivated to work in journalism and news to give students today a better chance at being informed about our world.
