  p1: 'Think of a media-related issue or question you find interesting (e.g., misinformation on social media, representation in film, streaming habits). Now imagine researching that issue without using any theory—just collecting facts. What would be missing from your findings? Reflect on how theory might deepen or improve your ability to explain or understand the issue. What questions might theory help you ask?'
  p2: 'After reading about the social scientific, interpretive, and critical/cultural paradigms, which approach feels most aligned with how you think about research, or how you want to think about it? Why? Share a media topic you care about and describe how your chosen paradigm would shape your research questions, methods, and the kind of insights you might produce.'
  p3: 'Pick one communication theory mentioned in this chapter (e.g., Cultivation Theory, Social Comparison Theory, Feminist Theory). Briefly describe how this theory interprets a real-world communication problem (e.g., violence in media, body image, online harassment). Then reflect on how your understanding of the issue changes when seen through that theoretical lens. What does the theory help you notice that you might not have otherwise?'

While thinking about this prompt, I took the route of studying representation in film. I believe it would be relatively easy to research the fact-based data of what it means to have representation in film. I can imagine finding the percentage of speaking roles for different groups or how top-grossing films had lead actors of color, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, etc. These questions would inevitably yield a numerical answer. Without any theory, I would have a large set of numbers, but nothing to provide any context for any deeper thought or research.

In my personal grad program path, I have been looking forward to my Media Theory class and this Research Methods class. I continue to be excited about finding ways to apply theory to my final project and also how research will help my grad work stand on its own with data to back up my work. There have been a number of theories I’ve been exposed to in Dr. Baasanjav’s class in the first month. If I take my route of studying representation in film, there are a few theories that come to mind that would give context to the research data I could source about representation or lack thereof. 

Looking at representation in film through the lens of George Gerbner’s Cultivation Theory, we could study how consistent portrayals of different represented groups impact public attitudes on those groups. After all, perception is reality. If you see a Black women onscreen consistently as loud and aggressive, you very well may see that same group as loud and aggressive in your real life. This can go another way in terms of representation as Gay men being promiscuous and effeminate or White women being pious and innocent. We’re talking about stereotypes here. Most of the time, the stereotypes of any given group are outdated and lazy. 

Looking at representation in film through the lens of Marxist Media Theory would yield deeper insights on how the general public view groups outside of their race/gender/class. The idea of keeping white hegemony in the subconscious minds of moviegoers would be an interesting angle to research. The main question here would be asking who benefits from certain stereotypes in the movie that are written, produced, filmed, and distributed to the widest audience. In Marx’s eyes, the benefits in question here are dollars and box office returns.

The numbers that I could source for representation in film would give me only one medium-sized piece of the puzzle here. Applying a media theory to this research would give the work structure to grow in terms of criticism. The deeper questions at play would rise from the theory, not just the basic countout of how many films have an Indian man as the lead.
